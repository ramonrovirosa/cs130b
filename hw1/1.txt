//a
Given:
Hanoi(n, A, B, C) ⇒ Hanoi(1, A, C, B) + Hanoi(n − 1, A, B, C) + Hanoi(1, C, B, A)

This strategy will NOT work to solve towers of Hanoi.

CounterExample:
Given n=4
After performing Hanoi(1, A, C, B)...
There is no way to move n-1 disks onto B without stacking a larger disk on top of a smaller one, which would be illegal.


//b
If n = 2^k
Hanoi(n, A, B, C) ⇒ Hanoi(n/2, A, C, B) + Hanoi(n/2, A, B, C) + Hanoi(n/2, C, B, A)
This strategy will NOT work to solve towers of Hanoi.

CounterExample:
Case n=1;
Given k=0, we get n=1.
So in the case where n=1 (we have one disk)
This strategy will not work because it would be impossible to divide one single disk in half.
