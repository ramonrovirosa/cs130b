//Ramon Rovirosa
//Problem 3
//2 Warehouse Problem

a)
    Recurrence relation:
    //The cost for sending supplies from W1 & W2 to Destination i is:

   gi(x) = min{gi-1(x-x1,j)+c1,j(x1,j)+c2,j(dj-x1,j)}


b)
    Algorithm:

    optimal[n]
    min=INFINITY
    for i: 0->n
    	for x1,j: 0 -> dj
    		if( gi-1(x-x1,j)+c1,j(x1,j)+c2,j(dj-x1,j) < min)
    			min = gi-1(x-x1,j)+c1,j(x1,j)+c2,j(dj-x1,j)
    			optimal[n] = x1,j

    Complexity: O(n^2)

c)
    Show steps and tables of your DP algorithm on this particular problem instance: two warehouses with supply of 10
    and 7 units, ﬁve destinations with demands of 4, 3, 2, 5, and 3 units. The cost of supplying these destinations from
    warehouse one is 1, 2, 3, 1, 2/unit and from warehouse two is 2, 3, 3, 1, 1/unit.
